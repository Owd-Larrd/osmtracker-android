=To do=

  * Better landscape screen support. The buttons grid dimensions should be defined in regard of the screen W/H ratio.
  * Implements a notification system while tracking in background.
  * GPX save from database is long and blocks UI. Change that, maybe for an Asynctask, but must manage the fact that user starts another tracks while saving !
    * Temporary solution could be a progress bar when exporting.

=Done=
  * Have a true background service capable of keep tracking when the ui is gone, and connect back to the UI when it's launched again.
  * Component are oddly organized. Service should not have reference to the UI (?)
