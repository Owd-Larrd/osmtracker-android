=To do=

  * Better landscape screen support. The buttons grid dimensions should be defined in regard of the screen W/H ratio.
  * Implements a notification system while tracking in background.
  * Add a user notification while saving GPX track. Actually this is done in background without any indication for the user
  * Add a shortcut to Android GPS settings, and maybe detect if the GPS is off when starting application

=Done=
  * Have a true background service capable of keep tracking when the ui is gone, and connect back to the UI when it's launched again.
  * Component are oddly organized. Service should not have reference to the UI (?)
