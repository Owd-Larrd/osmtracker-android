  * Doesn't support backgrounding: If you return to home screen, click on back, or receive a phone call, it will exit. Your track will still be saved, though.
  * Doesn't support screen orientation: Works only in portrait mode.
  * On long tracks, the GPX export can be long and block the UI. GPX exports take about 1s per 1000 gps points on a HTC Magic.
