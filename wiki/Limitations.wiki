=Limitations=

  * Doesn't support screen orientation: Works only in portrait mode.
  * Supports only 3GPP format for voice recording. This is a limitation of Android SDK which is unable to record in mp3. 

=Previous limitations now fixed=
  * Doesn't support backgrounding: If you return to home screen, click on back, or receive a phone call, it will exit. Your track will still be saved, though.
    * Side effect:  Settings screen doesn't work well when tracking ;-) Try to use it only when you're not currently tracking.
    * *Fixed in v0.2.x* : If you exit the UI while recording a track, it continues recording. Launch the UI again to get control back and stop tracking.
  * On long tracks, the GPX export can be long and block the UI. GPX exports take about 1s per 1000 gps points on a HTC Magic.
    * *Fixed in v0.2.x* : As the service is now really backgrounding, the export isn't done anymore in the UI Thread. However it can have side effects if you start a new track while the background service is still exporting the previous one...
